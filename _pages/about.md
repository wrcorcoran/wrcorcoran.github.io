Hello there!

Currently, I'm a second-year computer science student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. While I am only a second-year, I will graduate early in the Spring of 2025, making me a junior. As of now, I plan on getting my Master's degree in computer science and heading to industry after.

Originally, I'm from Burlington, Washington, a semi-rural farm town about an hour north of Seattle. I love the Pacific Northwest and consider it my home, however, Santa Barbara is hard to beat. I consider myself extremely blessed to study at such a quality university in such a beautiful place.

My interests lie in all sorts of areas. I've always been an avid creative, founding an independent music label, [_9929 Records_](/projects), which has seen an incredible amount of streams. My life before college was devoted to athletics, something I still hold dear to my heart. However, as I've become dedicated to computer science, I've been enamored with computability theory, quantum computing, cryptocurrency, and securityâ€”all I wish I knew more about. I'm also a huge fan of the outdoors, and I love to hike, camp, and run.

Feel free to react out to me via email!
