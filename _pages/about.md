Hello there!

Currently, I'm a second-year computer science student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. While I am only a second year, I will graduate early in the Spring of 2025, making me a junior. As of now, I plan on getting my master's degree in computer science and am unsure about PhD or industry.

Originally, I'm from Burlington, Washington, a semi-rural farm town about an hour north of Seattle. I love the Pacific Northwest and consider it my home, however, Santa Barbara is hard to beat. I consider myself extremely blessed to study at a university in such a beautiful place.

My interests lie in all sorts of areas. I've always been an avid creative, founding an independent music label, [_9929 Records_](/projects/1_project), which has seen an incredible amount of streams. My life before college was devoted to athletics, something I still hold dear to my heart. However, as I've become dedicated to computer science, I've become enamored with theoretical computer science, specifically computation and graphs. As a bachelor's student, I feel my learning has just begun; education is a lifelong commitment. I'm also a huge fan of the outdoors, and I love to hike, camp, and run.

Feel free to reach out to me via email!
