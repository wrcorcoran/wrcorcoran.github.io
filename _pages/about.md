Hello there!

Currently, I'm a third-year computer science student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I will graduate with my Bachelor of Science in the Spring of 2025 and continue to graduate with my Master of Science in the Spring of 2026. My interests lie in all sorts of areas: randomized algorithms and graph and topological machine learning. I've accepted an offer to be a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services on the Elastic Container Services team in the Summer of 2025.

Originally, I'm from Burlington, Washington, a semi-rural farm town about an hour north of Seattle. I'm an outdoors fan and love to hike, camp, and run.

Feel free to reach out to me via email!

Please check out my [research](/research) and [cv](/cv).
