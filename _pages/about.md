Hello there!

Currently, I'm a third-year computer science student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I will graduate with my Bachelor of Science in the Spring of 2025 and continue to graduate with my Master of Science in the Spring of 2026. I plan to pursue a research path, which likely will require me to obtain a PhD. I feel my learning has just begun; education is a lifelong commitment. 

Originally, I'm from Burlington, Washington, a semi-rural farm town about an hour north of Seattle. I love the Pacific Northwest and consider it my home, though, Santa Barbara is hard to beat. I consider myself extremely blessed to study at a university in such a beautiful place.

My interests lie in all sorts of areas: randomized algorithms, graph theory, and graph neural networks.

I'm also an outdoors fan, and I love to hike, camp, and run.

Feel free to reach out to me via email!
