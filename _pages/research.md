Currently, I have little information on my upcoming research. Please check back in two weeks for more information.

I will be a part of UCSB's Early Research Scholars Program, which is a program that allows undergraduate students to conduct research with a professor with a group of three other classmates.
There is a culminating research presentation at the end of the program, which will be held in June.
