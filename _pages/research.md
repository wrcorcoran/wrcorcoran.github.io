## Summary
This year, I will be researching in the [Dynamic Networks: Analysis and Modeling Lab (Dynamo)](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu/) under guidance from Dr. Ambuj Singh. 
Fortunately, this is through [UCSB's Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/home).

## GitHub
See the repository [here](https://github.com/wrcorcoran/querying-graphs)!

## Project
Here is a broad description of this year's [research project](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/2023-2024-projects/group-6-2023-2024):
- Graph neural networks transform the nodes of a graph into a high dimensional latent space.
- This project will contrast the distances between nodes of a graph in the input space (graph structure) to their embedding in the latent space.
- Queries of interest will be finding node/subgraph outliers, and comparing representations produced by different deep learning methods.
- Project can be extended to consider different ways of reducing distortions in embeddings and measuring the local dimensionality of the embedding space.

**Professor**: [Dr. Ambuj Singh](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ambuj/)

**Graduate Mentor**: [Danish Ebadulla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LNzVTfcAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Winter

Please see the [research log](https://github.com/wrcorcoran/2324_TeamSingh_ERSP) for updates.

We have pivoted to the [*minimum edge set perturbation problem*](https://github.com/wrcorcoran/minimum-edge-set-perturbation). Here is the guiding question:

What is the maximum number of edges which can be added to a graph without changing the accuracy of a graph neural network classification? Are there certain metrics (homophily, degree, nearest neighbors), which provide an algorithmic way to do add these edges? How does this compare to standard adversarial attacks?
