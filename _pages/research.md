## Summary
This year, I will be researching in the [Dynamic Networks: Analysis and Modeling Lab (Dynamo)](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu/) under guidance from Dr. Ambuj Singh. 
Fortunately, this is through [UCSB's Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/home).

## Project
As the year just began, I am just starting in the lab. Here is description of this year's [research project](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/2023-2024-projects/group-6-2023-2024):
- Graph neural networks transform the nodes of a graph into a high dimensional latent space.
- This project will contrast the distances between nodes of a graph in the input space (graph structure) to their embedding in the latent space.
- Queries of interest will be finding node/subgraph outliers, and comparing representations produced by different deep learning methods.
- Project can be extended to consider different ways of reducing distortions in embeddings and measuring the local dimensionality of the embedding space.

## Log of Findings and Progess:
