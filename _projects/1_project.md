Originally, something that started with a few friends.

It turned into so much more.

For some time, it was my life. 

I've been obsessed with music production since a very young age. Around 11 or 12, I started to play around with GarageBand on my computer. 
I quickly asked my parents for a laptop so I could use FL Studio. I'd never felt something so interesting before. Music, and especially creating music, made me feel something I'd never felt before.

I felt creative.

Quickly, creativity turned into my life. I even did my valedictorian's speech on creativity.

During our sophomore year, my best friends and I started to make songs. They weren't great, but they were enjoyable for us because we had made them. I convinced my family to let me turn our old chicken coop into a studio.
I bought the nicest gear I could afford--two HS5s, a Scarlett 2i2, and a Rode NT1. Immediately, our first song was unbelievably better than before. We were hooked.

Eventually, every evening was spent in the studio. We worked so hard on the projects we believed in. I grew as a mixing engineer, something I'd never done before the studio was built.

About two years after the studio was built, we'd grown to a sizeable audience. We were able to throw a concert. We used my gym--rented a stage and some speakers. We roped 225 people into that small gym. It was the best night of my life.
I received compliments I'd never thought I'd hear. We felt famous.

But then, as all good things do, it came crashing down. Quicker than it arrived, my love for music died.

I didn't feel creative anymore. I didn't feel like I was making anything worthwhile. I felt like I was wasting my time. 

I was going to college. I needed to grow up. I needed to study.

So I did. I stopped making music.

After a while, one of my friends texted me and said he wanted to release one of the songs we'd made. I was hesitant, but I agreed.
So, there I was, in my dorm room, mixing "Lova" by b3n.

I cried. I cried because I realized how much I missed it. 

It brought back the sensation I hadn't felt in a while. I felt creative again. I apologized to my friends and told them I was back. 

I went home for Spring Break, and we rented an Airbnb. We found ourselves. This time, it was different. The genre had evolved. We were creating our vision. 
No longer were we limiting ourselves to what we thought would be popular. We made what we felt.

After all, musical composition is the translation of the artist's mental perception.

Four months later, we released "To: You."

"To: You" was the perfect encapsulation of all the unreleased creativity we'd had. 

I consider it the epitome of our work and am beyond proud of it. 

It means an insurmountable amount to me.

Enjoy life. Be creative.
